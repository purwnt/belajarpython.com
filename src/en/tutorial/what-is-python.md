[Python](https://www.python.org) is a multipurpose interpretive programming language. Unlike other languages that are hard to read and understand, Python emphasizes code readability to make syntax easier to understand. This makes Python very easy to learn for both beginners and those who have already mastered other programming languages.

This language first appeared in 1991, designed by a person named [Guido van Rossum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guido_van_Rossum). Until now, Python is still developed by the [Python Software Foundation](https://www.python.org/psf/). The Python language supports almost all operating systems, even for Linux operating systems, almost all distributions include Python in it.

Python has become one of the most popular programming languages in the world, mainly because of its dominant role in the fields of:

- **Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning** - Libraries like TensorFlow, PyTorch, and scikit-learn make Python the top choice for AI development.
- **Data Science and Data Analysis** - Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib are industry standard tools.
- **Web Development** - Frameworks like Django, Flask, and FastAPI.
- **Automation and Scripting** - Automating repetitive tasks easily.
- **Internet of Things (IoT)** - Used in Raspberry Pi and embedded devices.

The latest version of Python currently is **Python 3.13** with various modern features like pattern matching, improved error messages, and better performance.

With simple and easy-to-implement code, a programmer can prioritize the development of the application being created, rather than being busy looking for syntax errors.

```python
print("Python is very simple")
```

Just by writing the print code as above, you can print anything you want inside the parentheses `()`. Even at the end of the code, you don't have to end it with a semicolon `;`
